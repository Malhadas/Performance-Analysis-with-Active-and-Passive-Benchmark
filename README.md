# Performance-Analysis-with-Active-and-Passive-Benchmark
This paper presents an in-depth study on two distinct performance analysis techniques, with them being benchmark active and passive benchmark. In order to understand the differences between the results obtained with each of these techniques both are used to analyze the performance of applications under the same conditions (as reference application will be used IOzone), then the results are compared and evaluated making it possible to observe the Differences and advantages of the active method for the passive method. It should also be noted that all of this study was performed in a Solaris 11 environment and, for this reason, the instrumented data will be related only to this environment.
